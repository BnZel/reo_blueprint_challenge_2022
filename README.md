## REO Blueprint Competition

A competition from  July 2022 to August  2022 (STEM Fellowship) where a fellow colleague and I worked on in **NSII (Northern Shores Innovation Institute)**

The competition had us chose a variety of climate change related topics. We choose to approach effects on crop yields.

**My colleague researched into the specifics of crop yields**, while I utilized **Python (Numpy, Pandas, Selenium)** to visualize and organize the information into datasets.

More information is attached on our paper.

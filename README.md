## REO Blueprint Competition

A competition from  July 2022 to August  2022 (STEM Fellowship) where a fellow colleague and I worked on in **NSII (Northern Shores Innovation Institute)**

The competition had us chose a variety of climate change related topics. We choose to approach effects on crop yields.

**My colleague researched into the specifics of crop yields**, while I utilized [Python (Numpy, Pandas, Selenium)](https://github.com/BnZel/reo_blueprint_challenge_2022/blob/master/reo_dataset.ipynb) to visualize and organize the information into datasets.

More information is attached on our [paper](https://github.com/BnZel/reo_blueprint_challenge_2022/blob/master/REO_Blueprint_Project_2022_Sam_and_Jason.pdf).
